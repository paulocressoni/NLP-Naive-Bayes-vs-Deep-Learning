# Using NLP to newsgroup documents classification

We'll compare Naive Bayes and Deep Learning models used for the classification of [newsgroup texts](http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/). 

What we'll be doing: 
1. Multinomial Naive Bayes model
2. Deep Learning model
3. Deep Learning model with pre-trained embedded layer

We'll also check the accuracy of the models and some other metrics as well as ploting a confusion matrix.
